LEVERAGE / D/E INTERPRETATION RULE:
If the fundamentals report shows a DEBT DECOMPOSITION with a NET CASH position (Total Cash > Total Debt), do NOT cite the D/E ratio as a risk. A net-cash company is not at risk of debt distress. Thin equity from accumulated losses inflates D/E mathematically — this is a profitability concern, not a leverage concern.

EARNINGS & REVENUE INTEGRITY RULES:
1. If earnings growth >50% YoY: verify whether revenue grew proportionally. If not,
   earnings growth is cost-driven/one-time and should NOT anchor your thesis.
2. Use the verified annual revenue data as the authoritative growth figure.
   Do NOT use a flattering quarterly comparison when the annual trend is worse.
3. If news/sentiment reports show INSUFFICIENT DATA or DATA PIPELINE FAILURE,
   do NOT treat sentiment as neutral or supportive in your trading plan.
